    When SpaceX was founded by Elon Musk in 2002, its aim was ambitious but revolutionary. Its mission was to make space travel affordable and 
    make humanity multiplanetary. Today, that vision is embodied in Starship, a fully reusable spacecraft designed to transport humans and cargo to the Moon and Mars.
