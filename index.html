    SpaceX’s Starship represents a transformative step in the pursuit of interplanetary travel, embodying advancements in 
    rocket design, propulsion technology, and reusability. Since its inception as the Interplanetary Transport System in 2016,
    Starship has undergone significant refinements in size, materials, and propulsion. The shift to stainless steel for 
    structural components marked a breakthrough in cost-effectiveness and thermal resilience. Central to its development
    is the evolution of the Raptor engine, progressing from 185 metric tons of thrust in early iterations to the Raptor 3,
    which now produces 280 metric tons, enabling unprecedented payload capacities.

    Through iterative testing, including the SN-series prototypes and the integrated Super Heavy booster, SpaceX has refined
    key aspects such as atmospheric re-entry and vertical landing. These advancements position Starship as a versatile platform
    for Mars colonization, lunar exploration, and commercial missions. The continuous improvement of its Raptor engines 
    highlights SpaceX's engineering prowess, bringing humanity closer to sustainable and affordable space exploration.

  </p>

  <pre>
    When SpaceX was founded by Elon Musk in 2002, its aim was ambitious but revolutionary. Its mission was to 
    make space travel affordable and make humanity multiplanetary. Today, that vision is embodied in Starship, 
    a fully reusable spacecraft designed to transport humans and cargo to the Moon and Mars. [<a href="#ref-clark2022">Clark, 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-howell2023">Howell, 2023</a>].

<h3 id="The Start of Starship">The Start of Starship</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
  While SpaceX has already achieved groundbreaking success with the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets since 2010, 
  SpaceX needed a vehicle capable of going the extra mile. This gave rise to the Starship program, initially names 
  as the interplanetary transport system (ITS) in 2016. The ITS had many of the base features still used in the current Starship, such as:
    •	The use of raptor engines, powered by liquid methane and oxygen
    •	A payload of over 300 tons whilst still being a reusable rocket, far exceeding existing capabilities
    •	Being the biggest rocket ever built towering at the height of 122 meters
  Whilst many shrugged off the concept of the ITS, Musk was set on his task to make this project come into reality. 
  However, the concept had to broken down into more feasible chunks to manage, so the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) was created in 2017.
  </pre>
<h3 id="BFR">BFR</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
<pre>
  The BFR introduced several groundbreaking innovations, including the use of stainless steel for its structure. Initially seen as unconventional,
  stainless steel proved to be a game-changer for cost and performance. Its high melting point and ability to handle extreme temperature swings
  made it ideal for both atmospheric re-entry and deep-space operations. Powered by 31 Raptor engines, the BFR’s first stage was designed to 
  provide the massive thrust needed to lift Starship out of Earth’s atmosphere, while the second stage, later officially named Starship, was 
  capable of carrying passengers and cargo to destinations like Mars, the Moon, or low Earth orbit.
</pre>
<h3 id="BFR to Starship">BFR to Starship</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
<pre>
  By 2018, the BFR had changed its name to Starship, with the booster stage becoming Super heavy, this was the start of a greater vision for SpaceX.
  In 2019 Starhopper was built to test the Raptor engine and landing systems. In a series of short flights, it demonstrated successful vertical
  take-offs and landings, paving the way to more ambitious prototypes. 
</pre>
<h3 id="The Start of the SN Series">The Start of the SN Series</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
<pre>
  Following the success of Starhopper, SpaceX moved onto building larger prototypes, labelled Serial Number (SN). These rockets combined the Star 
  hoppers technology with the BFR`s, improving the vehicles capacity to perform high altitude flights, and landing manoeuvres.
    •	SN5 and SN6 (2020): These prototypes were similar to the Starhopper, conducting low altitude flights. 
      Both successfully completing 150 meter hops, before safely landing again, testing the reliability of the raptor engines and the landing capabilities.
    •	SN8 to SN11 (2020-2021): These flights performed high altitude tests, flying to heights of up to 10km. During these flights, 
      Starship started testing more efficient ways to land the vehicle, coming up with its iconic “belly flop” manoeuvre, increasing the drag 
      and reducing the landing velocity. While many of these tests ended in explosions during landing attempts, this aided them in improving the vehicle for future flights. 
    •	SN15 (2021): Finally after much trial and error the SN15 completed a high altitude launch and landed without incident. 
      This success validated the design of the ship and allowed spaceX to start working on other improvements such as major 
      upgrades to the raptor engines, heat shielding, and landing systems. Each test bringing them closer to realizing their vision.

<h3 id="Super Heavy">Super Heavy</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
<pre>
  As Starship prototypes continued to improve, SpaceX began developing the Super Heavy booster, the first stage designed to 
  provide the thrust necessary to launch starship into orbit and land safely. The Super Heavy booster, designed to complement Starship, 
  represents another major milestone in the rocket’s development. Powered by 33 Raptor 2 engines, it generates over 7,590 metric tons (16.7 million pounds) 
  of thrust, surpassing the Saturn V, which previously held the record for the most powerful rocket. This level of power is essential for lifting the fully-loaded Starship into orbit.
  The first integrated orbital test of Starship and Super Heavy in 2023 demonstrated the immense potential of this system. While the test revealed areas for improvement, 
  such as engine reliability and structural durability, it also showcased the incredible power and capability of the Raptor 2 engines.
</pre>
<h3 id="Recent Advancements in Starship’s Design">Recent Advancements in Starship’s Design</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
<pre>
  In addition to engine improvements, Starship’s overall design has evolved significantly. The stainless steel structure, initially met with scepticism,
  has proven to be a cost-effective and high-performance material. It can withstand extreme temperature swings, making it ideal for both atmospheric 
  re-entry and deep-space operations. The thermal protection system has also seen upgrades, with the addition of hexagonal heat shield tiles 
  to protect the spacecraft during re-entry. Furthermore, SpaceX has made strides in rapid reusability, developing innovative systems like Mechazilla, 
  a tower designed to catch and reset the booster for its next flight.<a href="#ref1">[Space.com, 2024]</a>

<h3 id="Future Applications and the Road Ahead">Future Applications and the Road Ahead</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
<pre>
  The advancements in Raptor engines and Starship’s design pave the way for a wide range of future applications. These include:
    •	Mars Colonization: Supporting human settlement on the Red Planet through reusable spacecraft capable of carrying large crews and cargo.
    •	Lunar Missions: Contributing to NASA’s Artemis program by delivering astronauts and supplies to the Moon.
    •	Commercial Use: Launching satellites, enabling space tourism, and providing global internet coverage through Starlink.
    •	Scientific Exploration: Facilitating deep-space missions to explore asteroids, comets, and distant planets.

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
<pre>
  Starship’s journey from concept to reality is a testament to SpaceX’s relentless pursuit of innovation. The Raptor engine, in particular, 
  has exemplified this spirit, improving from early prototypes to the powerful and efficient Raptor 2. With each iteration, Starship brings 
  humanity closer to achieving the dream of sustainable space exploration and interplanetary travel. This evolution not only pushes technological 
  boundaries but also inspires a new generation to reach for the stars.
